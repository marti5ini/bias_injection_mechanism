class GPR(object):
    """Estimator based on Gaussian Process Regressor

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float or ndarray of shape (n_samples,), default=1e-10
        Value added to the diagonal of the kernel matrix during fitting.
        This can prevent a potential numerical issue during fitting, by
        ensuring that the calculated values form a positive definite matrix.
        It can also be interpreted as the variance of additional Gaussian
        measurement noise on the training observations. Note that this is
        different from using a `WhiteKernel`. If an array is passed, it must
        have the same number of entries as the data used for fitting and is
        used as datapoint-dependent noise level. Allowing to specify the
        noise level directly as a parameter is mainly for convenience and
        for consistency with Ridge.

    kernel : kernel instance, default=None
        The kernel specifying the covariance function of the GP. If None is
        passed, the kernel ``ConstantKernel(1.0, constant_value_bounds="fixed"
        * RBF(1.0, length_scale_bounds="fixed")`` is used as default. Note that
        the kernel hyperparameters are optimized during fitting unless the
        bounds are marked as "fixed".

    optimizer : "fmin_l_bfgs_b" or callable, default="fmin_l_bfgs_b"
        Can either be one of the internally supported optimizers for optimizing
        the kernel's parameters, specified by a string, or an externally
        defined optimizer passed as a callable. If a callable is passed, it
        must have the signature::

            def optimizer(obj_func, initial_theta, bounds):
                # * 'obj_func' is the objective function to be minimized, which
                #   takes the hyperparameters theta as parameter and an
                #   optional flag eval_gradient, which determines if the
                #   gradient is returned additionally to the function value
                # * 'initial_theta': the initial value for theta, which can be
                #   used by local optimizers
                # * 'bounds': the bounds on the values of theta
                ....
                # Returned are the best found hyperparameters theta and
                # the corresponding value of the target function.
                return theta_opt, func_min

        Per default, the 'L-BGFS-B' algorithm from scipy.optimize.minimize
        is used. If None is passed, the kernel's parameters are kept fixed.
        Available internal optimizers are::

            'fmin_l_bfgs_b'

    n_restarts_optimizer : int, default=0
        The number of restarts of the optimizer for finding the kernel's
        parameters which maximize the log-marginal likelihood. The first run
        of the optimizer is performed from the kernel's initial parameters,
        the remaining ones (if any) from thetas sampled log-uniform randomly
        from the space of allowed theta-values. If greater than 0, all bounds
        must be finite. Note that n_restarts_optimizer == 0 implies that one
        run is performed.

    normalize_y : bool, default=False
        Whether the target values y are normalized, the mean and variance of
        the target values are set equal to 0 and 1 respectively. This is
        recommended for cases where zero-mean, unit-variance priors are used.
        Note that, in this implementation, the normalisation is reversed
        before the GP predictions are reported.

    copy_X_train : bool, default=True
        If True, a persistent copy of the training data is stored in the
        object. Otherwise, just a reference to the training data is stored,
        which might cause predictions to change if the data is modified
        externally.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation used to initialize the centers.
        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.
        See :term: `Glossary <random_state>`.

    Nonlinear causal discovery with additive noise models

    Use GPML with Gaussian kernel and independent Gaussian noise,
    optimizing the hyper-parameters for each regression individually.
    For the independence test, we implemented the HSIC with a Gaussian kernel,
    where we used the gamma distribution as an approximation for the
    distribution of the HSIC under the null hypothesis of independence
    in order to calculate the p-value of the test result.
